          {`At Continuum, I spearheaded User Interface (UI)
                          development, ensuring intuitive design and seamless
                          functionality. My role encompassed implementing new
                          features, resolving bugs, and enhancing code
                          readability for ease of maintenance. Notably, I
                          optimized performance by reducing unnecessary API
                          calls through strategic rendering fixes and debouncing
                          techniques, resulting in a significant 30-40%
                          improvement in app performance. Additionally, I
                          collaborated with backend developers, providing
                          support and resolving issues as needed. Moreover, I
                          implemented Login and Register functionality for
                          Single Sign-On (SSO) users, contributing to a
                          streamlined authentication process. My contributions
                          were pivotal in elevating Continuum's data systems
                          integration capabilities.`}
